This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Description
This application is designed to help users find existing fitness establishments or events, save their favorites, and add to their calendars. This application is essentially a hybrid of ClassPass, Meetup.com, and Yelp.com, with no commitment to signing up. This is primarily for users who are interested in trying out new fitness classes that offer free first trials.

## Future Implementations
This project is currently in the build process. Plans are the following:

* Components:
  - Login
  - User Home Page
  - Browse Events
     - see how many others have saved it to their favorites (mutual friends' names will display, others will be just numbers)
     - see & leave reviews
  - User Favorites
  - View Friends' Favorites
  - maybe message friends who have favorited the same event
